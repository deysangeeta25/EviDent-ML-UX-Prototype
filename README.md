# EviDent-ML-UX-Prototype


This repository contains the prototype implementation of the **EviDent-ML** framework, developed to evaluate the **UI design and user experience** aspects of the proposed multi-layered collaborative approach for assessing training data quality in ML-based critical systems.

 **Note**: This is a *prototype* tool intended solely for *demonstration and evaluation purposes*. It is not a production-ready application.

## Overview

The prototype provides a user interface for exploring the evidence-based data requirements specification process. It simulates the flow of expert interaction, confidence assessment, and visualization of training data quality as per the EviDent-ML framework.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

No external dependencies or libraries are required.

## Running the Tool

This tool is designed to be run **locally on a desktop environment**. Follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Interact with the UI elements to simulate the framework workflow.

## Purpose and Scope

- Evaluate the layout and navigation of the proposed framework.
- Collect user feedback on usability and visual clarity.
- **No real database** is implemented.
